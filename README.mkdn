Helpers for AWS services using boto3. For now it contain a little helper for s3.

from aws_helpers import S3

s3 = S3()
s3 = s3({"region_name":"us-east-1"})
s3 = S3({"proxies":{"http":"proxy:8888"}})

for s3file in s3.list("my-bucket", "my-prefix"):
  with s3.get(s3file.bucket_name, s3file.key, decoder=simplejson.loads) as f:
    for js in f:
      # ... do something with js

with s3.put("my-bucket", "my-key", encoder=simplejson.dumps) as f:
  f.write({"my":"doc"})
  f.write({"my":"other doc"})
```

## S3Streamer

```python
from aws_helpers import S3, S3Streamer

def decode(s3file, s3):
    with s3.get(path=s3file, decoder=simplejson.loads) as f:
        for js in f:
            yield js["..."]

for msg in S3Stream(path="s3://...", func=decode, func_init = lambda x: S3(), ):
    # do something with msg
```
